# Alzheimer's Detection Using CNN and MRI-Scans


Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Alzheimer's detection using MRI scans, implementing the AlexNet architecture entirely from scratch without utilizing any inbuilt library functions. This involved preprocessing MRI datasets, designing and coding the model architecture, and training the network to achieve accurate classification of Alzheimer's stages. The project showcased a strong understanding of deep learning principles, algorithm optimization, and the practical application of neural networks for early disease detection.
